# Pac-Man

If the title doesn't clue you in, I'm remaking Pac-Man with SDL and Rust.

The project is *extremely* early in development, but check back in a week, and maybe I'll have something cool to look
at.

## Feature Targets

- Near-perfect replication of logic, scoring, graphics, sound, and behaviors.
- Written in Rust, buildable on Windows, Linux, Mac and WebAssembly.
- Online demo, playable in a browser.
